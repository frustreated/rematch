  """Force functions to run in IDA's main thread.

  Access to IDA's IDB database is not thread-safe, so access should only be
  done from IDA's main thread, or IDB corruption and unpredictable results may
  occour.

  This decorator is used to transparently force functions to run in IDA's main
  thread. If a function decorated by `IdaKernelQueue` is called from within
  IDA's main thread, it will simply be executed immidiately by
  `ida_kernwin.execute_sync`. Otherwise it'll be queued into IDA's main thread
  work queue, and will either block or return immidiately depending on the
  `wait` argument.

  Because execute_sync is only returning integers, we use the decorator class'
  context to store the return value temporarily from within the function
  executed in IDA's main thread context, and pick it back out in the original
  function's context. Thanks to python's GIL, synchronization and thread-safety
  it is guaranteed to work.
